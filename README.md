# Inspiration
Wanting to learn about using Image Recognition Tools to predict human features.

# What it does
Detects acne on your face with an image recognition model and then gives recommended products to use to tackle them.

# How we built it
Built with yolov11 for image recognition, openai for natural language processing, and react-native to display our features.

# Challenges we ran into
AWS cluster integration and connecting to Databases through the service

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Utilizing AWS to host database and EC2 instances

# What we learned
React-native, AWS, yolov11, and how to utilize these tools. Also learned how difficult the time constraints can be with hackathons. Learning how to manage time and split resources evenly.

# What's next for Acne Detection ML
Better trained model for more accurate predictions. Potential business operations with Amazon API integration. Etc.
